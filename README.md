## 🧠 What I do

After 12 years in industry solving complex technical challenges, I now build smart ML systems with a strong delivery mindset.

I build end-to-end AI solutions using:
- **MLflow, Vertex AI, Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, Streamlit, Gradio**
- **LangChain & OpenAI** to create smart AI agents
- **CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions**
